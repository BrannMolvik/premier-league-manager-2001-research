# Current State

_Last reconciled: 30 September 2026_

This is the **canonical live resume point**. Historical chronology belongs in
`PROGRESS.md`; established technical evidence belongs in `FINDINGS.md` and
topic-specific research files.

## Current gate

**Gate 13 - Restore original management presentation**

Gates 1 through 12 are complete. Gate 12 closed on 30 September 2026 after a
canonical real-data season reached the complete annual qualification snapshot
and atomically regenerated the year-two primary world.

Evidence:

- `research/GATE12_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md`
- `research/GATE12_ENGLISH_DOMESTIC_CUPS.md`
- `research/GATE12_EUROPEAN_COMPETITIONS.md`
- `research/GATE12_ENGLISH_DIVISIONS.md`
- `research/GATE12_ENGLISH_SEASON_TRANSITION.md`
- `research/GATE12_NEXT_SEASON_REGENERATION.md`

## Porting mission

This is a **Windows 11 modernization/port**. The supplied FM2001 archive/disc
contents are authorized for project use. Original FM2001 resources and
recoverable original behavior are the default source of truth. Use them
directly, convert them, or wrap them as needed; do not replace or redesign them
for convenience. Authorized original resources belong under
`original_assets/` with provenance tracked according to
`research/ASSET_POLICY.md`.

```

Dedicated GitHub Actions Gate 13 run `36699473176` passed **71/71 focused
tests**. Full reconstruction run `36699473326` ran **899 tests with 2 failures**,
exactly the two long-standing secondary-schedule assertions:

- secondary root-order assertion;
- secondary bucket-count assertion (262 expected vs 280 recovered).

All Gate-13 navigation, source-inventory, MODE1-conversion, native
ISO9660/Joliet inventory/extraction, and provenance-import tests passed.
Repository asset policy passed.

## Gate 12 closure checkpoint

The canonical annual run used the recovered fresh-game date **4 July 2000** and
reached a complete annual qualification snapshot on **4 June 2001**, after 335
simulated days.

It captured:

- played League sources `(0, 17, 21, 27, 31, 40, 50, 54)`;
- all 44 required DummyLeague ranking sources;
- all ten annual Cup sources `(1, 5, 9, 10, 19, 23, 33, 91, 98, 101)`.

The source-derived Champions League child phases 14/167 and WCC group phase 192
all ran live. Recovered League comparator `0x4F45E0` now resolves European
group ties with points, played, goal difference, goals for, goals against, then
CP1252 short-name bytes.

Atomic annual regeneration then:

- applied 28 membership changes;
- generated season year 2001;
- consumed 15,539 annual materialization draws;
- changed controller match RNG from `0xCE9A6E40` to `0x6F763739`;
- produced a fresh 380-fixture Premier League;
- produced 150 year-two primary-order dates;
- retained every played annual qualification-source League.

Internal save schema remains **34**.

## Stable startup / scheduler checkpoint

- DBTPlayers startup RNG: **180,384 calls** for 30,064 players;
- synthetic post-youth state: **`0x4B68DE28`**;
- actual-count primary competition RNG: **5,836 calls**;
- state entering primary `0x615BE0`: **`0x4F5CF274`**;
- complete primary schedule nodes: **9,346**;
- primary buckets: **373**;
- primary bucket-shuffle calls: **9,178**;
- state after primary schedule shuffle: **`0xD25DFFE6`**;
- first PL fixture order: **0, 6, 8, 5, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7**.

## Gate 13 live checkpoint: original source access restored

**Confirmed firsthand 30 September 2026:** the execution container now reads
the actual authorized original archive and raw disc bytes. Earlier container
`ClientError` notes in historical `PROGRESS.md` no longer describe the
current source-access state.

- Authoritative original ZIP is 511,121,336 bytes; directly calculated
  SHA-256: `677dcbc859109818d22599f34890ca7873393aea5adbf1f1f1a32d1a76f8a8a4`.
- ZIP contains the original 631,627,248-byte raw `famg2001.bin`
  MODE1/2352 CD track (CUE independently confirms its sector mode).
- All **268,549 physical sectors** were verified with zero invalid sectors.
- The original **Joliet level-3** filesystem was enumerated firsthand:
  **2,456 files, 211 folders, zero case-insensitive path collisions**.
  There are 1,354 `.444` image resources and 1,403
  `FM2001_Art` files. Refer to
  `research/GATE13_REAL_DISC_INVENTORY.md` for detailed counts, exact
  first-slice paths, sizes, independently calculated resource SHA-256 hashes,
  and a reproducible recovery procedure.
- Canonical `FM2001_Art/Generic/bground.444` was directly extracted and
  independently SHA-256-verified against prior research:
  **222,616 bytes, 800×600**, hash
  `9db0d71daf70d77b4f5f2307304bb8c5eac4ee3a07a85f2828b570fbbf3b7fb9`.
- Exact extracted originals also include
  `FM2001_Art/Generic/main_menu/main_menu_bground.444` (532×532),
  `FM2001_Art/Generic/team_choice/background.444` (800×558),
  TeamSelect choice animations, Premiership division graphics, original
  English text/index data, and several related first-slice resources.
  All targeted hashes are recorded in the first-hand inventory note.
- The actual original `footballmanager.exe` and copy under `crack/`
  were extracted independently and have identical SHA-256
  `833bf95e92a1c76ade47106f8ad7d3ca307069b7e5778a7067cd0658838b7cc3`,
  matching the prior verified executable used in reverse-engineering.
- Private current execution workspace contains the full derived catalog at
  `/mnt/data/fm2001-work/real_disc_catalog.json`, staged first-slice bytes
  at `/mnt/data/fm2001-work/staging/`, and the full selected hash receipt
  `/mnt/data/fm2001-work/first_slice_receipt.json`. These are **temporary
  workspace paths**. If unavailable in a future chat, regenerate them from
  the canonical private Library ZIP using the repository's native inventory,
  rather than requesting a re-upload. The detailed confirmed research note
  and ZIP SHA are durable in GitHub. An attempted Library backup upload
  of the complete catalog failed with `container_session_expired`, so do
  **not** incorrectly assume that complete report is already persistently
  saved outside this container.

Existing architectural boundary remains verified:

- `front_end_state.py` preserves recovered original controls: PStartMenu
  ID `0x323`, New Game event `2`, TeamSelect Back `0x29`,
  Start/Continue `0x2A`.
- `front_end_session.py` connects that recovered control contract to
  the working Premier League backend without moving simulation logic
  into the presentation layer.
- Prior dedicated Gate-13 CI run `36699473176` passed 71/71 synthetic
  focused tests; full suite run `36699473326` had 899 tests and only
  the two already documented secondary-schedule failures. These tests
  predate the first real-disc inspection and do not independently validate
  the new original `.444` images.

## Latest original EA444 decoder implementation and local evidence

The real-disc catalog and original checksum facts above remain canonical.
Original graphics no longer need to be guessed or rediscovered.

- `ea444_header.py` validates all 1,354 original `.444` headers.
  `ea444_bits.py` implements original little-endian-DWORD,
  most-significant-bit-first compressed bit ordering.
- `ea444_tables.py` reconstructs original coefficient permutation
  and 160-entry Huffman lookup from the exact canonical executable's
  initialized `TQIA_DAT` PE section; its SHA is checked.
- `ea444_coefficients.py` implements the source-backed 8-bit
  scale/DC, variable Huffman run-length, signed AC amplitude, 14-bit
  escape and EOB parsing for one component. All **17** real first-slice
  graphic assets produced valid first component blocks.
- `ea444_quantization.py` reads the 64 original `.rdata`
  quantization seeds at VA `0x7DABF0` and reproduces the x86
  `IMUL/SHL/SHR/ADC` 16.16 scaling and signed low-DWORD
  multiplication. The source 256-byte table SHA is
  `6fb2af66cb6a51e4b3fa7da9bacab417fa40f180aa0c18c85adb2550c04c89eb`.
- `ea444_quantized_block.py` maps raw sparse coefficients to the
  canonical 64-position, pre-inverse-transform component grid,
  rejecting repeated or out-of-range positions.
- Actual menu background first component: scale code **15**, **14**
  signed AC coefficients, **93 consumed bits**, **15** nonzero
  pre-transform fixed-point grid values and packed-grid SHA
  `d074fa03f380438bfccbdf88dc2375f700434891889399e4750fc7bc2c75c2d7`.
  The reproduced DC fixed-point value is **983040**.
- Source-backed local tests: 12/12 across bitstream, original
  executable Huffman tables and sparse coefficients. Original
  quantization and combined-grid measurements independently verified
  using the actual private original executable and menu bytes.
  The newest additional quantization/grid regression files are
  committed, but **no new hosted CI run has yet been claimed**;
  hosted Gate-13 workflow is PR/manual only to conserve CI minutes.
- Research, original entry points and the incomplete 2-pass IDCT
  boundary are in `research/GATE13_EA444_DECODER_TRACE.md`.
  Original PNG and tiny `.444` source fixtures remain provenance-
  tracked in `original_assets/MANIFEST.md`.
- A subsequent attempt to save the complete derived catalog to
  private Library `/FM2001/Research/` again failed with
  `container_session_expired`. The original ZIP is safely retained;
  its metadata/hash research is in GitHub. Do not claim that the
  full derived catalog was backed up to Library.

## Exact next task within the full Gate-17 mission

1. Reproduce the original two-pass inverse 8×8 transform. Read
   `research/GATE13_EA444_DECODER_TRACE.md`, then disassemble
   original `0x7B9360` (first pass including verified DC-only
   shortcut at `0x7B948E`), `0x7B94C0` (second pass) and their
   caller `0x7B95D0`. Recover the exact initialized x87 constants
   at original `TQIA_DAT +0x10..+0x1F`; prove fixed-point,
   rounding and row/column scratch strides through direct source
   and tests before rendering final pixels.
2. Recover the conditional fourth-channel traversal and original
   post-transform RGB packing/clipping/transparency and dithering
   in `0x6868E0`, plus the alternate tile path `0x7BB960`.
   Verify pixels on small real source fixtures and one full menu
   background. Reject speculative generic FFmpeg/TGQ conversions.
3. Cross-reference menu/TeamSelect original image/layout loading,
   then provenance-import the minimal source-backed original
   `.444` resources and correct original labels using the
   verified STR/IDX parser. Connect to the tested
   `front_end_state.py`/`front_end_session.py` application
   boundary for recognizably original main-menu → TeamSelect.
4. Continue Gate 13 remaining screens and its exact roadmap
   audit. On passing it, automatically advance through Gates 14,
   15, 16 and 17, finishing with full automated tests and verified
   Windows 11 release package. A successful intermediate decoder
   commit is not a gate or mission completion.

## Known live fidelity boundaries

See `research/FIDELITY_GAPS.md`. The two existing secondary-schedule
assertions, original save compatibility, residual transfer/finance branches,
special both-controlled-participants Cup revenue, and presentation/audio
fidelity remain explicit later work. Do not promote historical synthetic
tooling verification as original-screen visual fidelity.
