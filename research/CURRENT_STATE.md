# Current State

_Last reconciled: 30 September 2026_

This is the **canonical live resume point**. Historical chronology belongs in
`PROGRESS.md`; established technical evidence belongs in `FINDINGS.md` and
topic-specific research files.

## Current gate

**Gate 13 - Restore original management presentation**

Gates 1 through 12 are complete. Gate 12 closed on 30 September 2026 after a
canonical real-data season reached the complete annual qualification snapshot
and atomically regenerated the year-two primary world.

Evidence:

- `research/GATE12_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md`
- `research/GATE12_ENGLISH_DOMESTIC_CUPS.md`
- `research/GATE12_EUROPEAN_COMPETITIONS.md`
- `research/GATE12_ENGLISH_DIVISIONS.md`
- `research/GATE12_ENGLISH_SEASON_TRANSITION.md`
- `research/GATE12_NEXT_SEASON_REGENERATION.md`

## Porting mission

This is a **Windows 11 modernization/port**. The supplied FM2001 archive/disc
contents are authorized for project use. Original FM2001 resources and
recoverable original behavior are the default source of truth. Use them
directly, convert them, or wrap them as needed; do not replace or redesign them
for convenience. Authorized original resources belong under
`original_assets/` with provenance tracked according to
`research/ASSET_POLICY.md`.

```

Dedicated GitHub Actions Gate 13 run `36699473176` passed **71/71 focused
tests**. Full reconstruction run `36699473326` ran **899 tests with 2 failures**,
exactly the two long-standing secondary-schedule assertions:

- secondary root-order assertion;
- secondary bucket-count assertion (262 expected vs 280 recovered).

All Gate-13 navigation, source-inventory, MODE1-conversion, native
ISO9660/Joliet inventory/extraction, and provenance-import tests passed.
Repository asset policy passed.

## Gate 12 closure checkpoint

The canonical annual run used the recovered fresh-game date **4 July 2000** and
reached a complete annual qualification snapshot on **4 June 2001**, after 335
simulated days.

It captured:

- played League sources `(0, 17, 21, 27, 31, 40, 50, 54)`;
- all 44 required DummyLeague ranking sources;
- all ten annual Cup sources `(1, 5, 9, 10, 19, 23, 33, 91, 98, 101)`.

The source-derived Champions League child phases 14/167 and WCC group phase 192
all ran live. Recovered League comparator `0x4F45E0` now resolves European
group ties with points, played, goal difference, goals for, goals against, then
CP1252 short-name bytes.

Atomic annual regeneration then:

- applied 28 membership changes;
- generated season year 2001;
- consumed 15,539 annual materialization draws;
- changed controller match RNG from `0xCE9A6E40` to `0x6F763739`;
- produced a fresh 380-fixture Premier League;
- produced 150 year-two primary-order dates;
- retained every played annual qualification-source League.

Internal save schema remains **34**.

## Stable startup / scheduler checkpoint

- DBTPlayers startup RNG: **180,384 calls** for 30,064 players;
- synthetic post-youth state: **`0x4B68DE28`**;
- actual-count primary competition RNG: **5,836 calls**;
- state entering primary `0x615BE0`: **`0x4F5CF274`**;
- complete primary schedule nodes: **9,346**;
- primary buckets: **373**;
- primary bucket-shuffle calls: **9,178**;
- state after primary schedule shuffle: **`0xD25DFFE6`**;
- first PL fixture order: **0, 6, 8, 5, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7**.

## Gate 13 live checkpoint: original source access restored

**Confirmed firsthand 30 September 2026:** the execution container now reads
the actual authorized original archive and raw disc bytes. Earlier container
`ClientError` notes in historical `PROGRESS.md` no longer describe the
current source-access state.

- Authoritative original ZIP is 511,121,336 bytes; directly calculated
  SHA-256: `677dcbc859109818d22599f34890ca7873393aea5adbf1f1f1a32d1a76f8a8a4`.
- ZIP contains the original 631,627,248-byte raw `famg2001.bin`
  MODE1/2352 CD track (CUE independently confirms its sector mode).
- All **268,549 physical sectors** were verified with zero invalid sectors.
- The original **Joliet level-3** filesystem was enumerated firsthand:
  **2,456 files, 211 folders, zero case-insensitive path collisions**.
  There are 1,354 `.444` image resources and 1,403
  `FM2001_Art` files. Refer to
  `research/GATE13_REAL_DISC_INVENTORY.md` for detailed counts, exact
  first-slice paths, sizes, independently calculated resource SHA-256 hashes,
  and a reproducible recovery procedure.
- Canonical `FM2001_Art/Generic/bground.444` was directly extracted and
  independently SHA-256-verified against prior research:
  **222,616 bytes, 800×600**, hash
  `9db0d71daf70d77b4f5f2307304bb8c5eac4ee3a07a85f2828b570fbbf3b7fb9`.
- Exact extracted originals also include
  `FM2001_Art/Generic/main_menu/main_menu_bground.444` (532×532),
  `FM2001_Art/Generic/team_choice/background.444` (800×558),
  TeamSelect choice animations, Premiership division graphics, original
  English text/index data, and several related first-slice resources.
  All targeted hashes are recorded in the first-hand inventory note.
- The actual original `footballmanager.exe` and copy under `crack/`
  were extracted independently and have identical SHA-256
  `833bf95e92a1c76ade47106f8ad7d3ca307069b7e5778a7067cd0658838b7cc3`,
  matching the prior verified executable used in reverse-engineering.
- Private current execution workspace contains the full derived catalog at
  `/mnt/data/fm2001-work/real_disc_catalog.json`, staged first-slice bytes
  at `/mnt/data/fm2001-work/staging/`, and the full selected hash receipt
  `/mnt/data/fm2001-work/first_slice_receipt.json`. These are **temporary
  workspace paths**. If unavailable in a future chat, regenerate them from
  the canonical private Library ZIP using the repository's native inventory,
  rather than requesting a re-upload. The detailed confirmed research note
  and ZIP SHA are durable in GitHub. An attempted Library backup upload
  of the complete catalog failed with `container_session_expired`, so do
  **not** incorrectly assume that complete report is already persistently
  saved outside this container.

Existing architectural boundary remains verified:

- `front_end_state.py` preserves recovered original controls: PStartMenu
  ID `0x323`, New Game event `2`, TeamSelect Back `0x29`,
  Start/Continue `0x2A`.
- `front_end_session.py` connects that recovered control contract to
  the working Premier League backend without moving simulation logic
  into the presentation layer.
- Prior dedicated Gate-13 CI run `36699473176` passed 71/71 synthetic
  focused tests; full suite run `36699473326` had 899 tests and only
  the two already documented secondary-schedule failures. These tests
  predate the first real-disc inspection and do not independently validate
  the new original `.444` images.

## Exact next task within the full Gate-17 mission

1. **Decode and inspect the now-recovered original `.444` resources**,
   starting with the directly verified main-menu and TeamSelect backgrounds.
   The proprietary image header's first two little-endian words give dimensions;
   the exact compressed pixel/animation data format still requires reverse
   engineering from `footballmanager.exe` or a proven compatible decoder.
   Recovered Loader444 paths include decode entry `0x68598A`, its
   initialization `0x6864A0`, color conversion `0x6868E0`, and
   low-level stream/decoder functions in `CSEG` at `0x7B9000`,
   `0x7B95D0` and `0x7BB960`. The **original executable is now present
   and hash-verified** in the private current workspace.
2. Correlate exact source graphics/layout/control references with the
   recovered executable PStartMenu and TeamSelect construction path. Do
   not infer control bindings solely from asset filenames.
3. Use `gate13_source_inventory.py --deep --hash-source
   --extract-path-file --only-explicit --require-all-explicit` to emit an
   independently reproducible selected-source receipt, then
   `gate13_asset_import.py --inventory-report` to import only the
   proven first-slice original resources into `original_assets/` with
   manifest hashes and original archive provenance.
4. Bind the authentic decoded resources to the already-tested
   `front_end_session.py` navigation/application seam; verify the
   recognizably original PStartMenu → TeamSelect UI before tackling the
   next management presentation screen. Keep original music and match
   presentation in Gate 14 unless needed as a Gate-13 dependency.
5. Continue Gate 13's remaining screens and audit; on passing its
   roadmap criteria, advance through Gates 14–17 automatically, with
   verified checkpoints and no speculative gate completion.

## Known live fidelity boundaries

See `research/FIDELITY_GAPS.md`. The two existing secondary-schedule
assertions, original save compatibility, residual transfer/finance branches,
special both-controlled-participants Cup revenue, and presentation/audio
fidelity remain explicit later work. Do not promote historical synthetic
tooling verification as original-screen visual fidelity.
