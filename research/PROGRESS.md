# Premier League Manager 2001 Reverse-Engineering Progress

_Last updated: 23 September 2026_

## Purpose

This file is the canonical resume point for the project. Any ChatGPT, Codex, or local-agent session working on this repository should read this file before starting new investigation.

## Current Goal

Reverse engineer Premier League Manager 2001 as completely as practical, including:

- executable startup and subsystem layout
- database and string-table formats
- clubs, players, managers, squads, competitions, fixtures, transfers, finances, training and scouting
- save-game format
- season progression and AI
- match engine and match-day presentation
- clean-room reimplementation experiments that read the user's original game data without depending on the legacy executable

The fallback remains a persistent VM if a faithful native reimplementation becomes disproportionate.

## Current State

GitHub persistence is active. The connected GitHub account is `BrannMolvik` and has push/admin access to this repository.

The previous v0.3 clean-room parser/reimplementation work is present in the active analysis workspace and its verified findings have now been imported into this repository.

A Windows 11 modernization attempt successfully reconstructed the game installation without the obsolete 16-bit installer, but Windows Smart App Control / Code Integrity blocks the unsigned legacy `footballmanager.exe` before execution. Event ID 3077 in the Code Integrity Operational log explicitly identified the executable as blocked.

A clean-room reimplementation prototype has therefore been started alongside executable reverse engineering.

## Newly completed investigation block

Static.dat tables immediately preceding the competition table were verified:

- `0x2670`: Formation table, 21 records × 6 bytes. Names include 4-4-2 variants, 5-3-2 variants, 3-4-3 variants, 3-5-2 variants, 4-3-3 variants, 4-5-1, 2-5-3, 5-4-1, Long Ball, Sweeper and Xmas Tree.
- `0x26F2`: Player-status table, 12 records × 4 bytes. Names include Injured, Banned, International, Cup Tied, First Team, Substitute, On loan, Out of contract, Transfer listed, Bid in, Wanted and Non EU.

These discoveries are documented in `research/FILE_FORMATS.md`.

## Active Investigation

Current focus: identify the remaining `Static.dat` tables surrounding the confirmed position/formation/status/competition sequence, then map league/cup allocation and fixture structures.

Immediate next steps:

1. Work backward from the position table to identify the preceding typed tables.
2. Work forward from the competition table and locate table boundaries.
3. Correlate table candidates with RTTI classes such as `DBTCountries`, `DBTNationalities`, `DBTRounds`, `DBTLeagueAllocations`, `DBTCupAllocInstructions`, `DBTRealFixtures`, and `DBTInternationalFixtures`.
4. Add a reproducible Static.dat table-inspection script under `tools/`.
5. Checkpoint each newly verified table before deeper executable tracing.

## Persistence / Checkpoint Rule

Do not perform a long investigation without saving intermediate progress.

For future work in ChatGPT:

- Work in small reverse-engineering blocks.
- After each meaningful subsystem discovery, write the result to the appropriate file in `research/` and/or code in `tools/` or `reconstruction/`.
- Commit to GitHub before moving into another long investigation block.
- If a task may time out, checkpoint partial findings before the expensive step.
- Never rely on conversation state as the only copy of a discovered offset, record layout, algorithm, failed experiment or next-step hypothesis.

If a session is interrupted, the repository is the canonical state.

## Resume Rule

A new session should:

1. Read `research/CONTINUATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
2. Read this file completely.
3. Read `research/FINDINGS.md`, `research/FILE_FORMATS.md`, `research/EXECUTABLE_ANALYSIS.md` and `research/FAILED_APPROACHES.md` as relevant.
4. Inspect recent commits.
5. Continue from the current Active Investigation section.

Do not repeat an earlier experiment solely because the conversation restarted.
